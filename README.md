Developing a responsive portfolio website using the bootstrap .css framework

## Description
With this excersize we were introduced to the Bootstrap .CSS Framework. The purpose being to utilize the plug and play nature of the framework to create a responsive portfolio page.


In the process of creating this website, I discovered it takes quite a bit of work and digging to create a layout that doesn't look so cookie cutter in nature. Many of the bootstrap selectors are redundant with there style attribute; one has to dig to find what exactly needs to be modified. 

As this is my first draft of a Bio/portfolio page to show potential employers I wanted to make sure it stood out, and didn't appear the same as a million+ other sites on the web. So while following the brief I also took time to style the individual bootstrap components. 

The background of my website is a photo of the mountains near my home, and I wanted that to be included in all design elements of the page.

  I learned how to make the nav elements transparent, so while they are present, they are unobtrusive and flow more with my desired layout.

  The main container element on each page uses a background-filter: style property to turn the image behind it to black and white and also blur and darken it. So, while the image is still present, a lighter font is easily read.
 
 Another suprising challenge was changing font colors through the website, it took some time in devTools to find which selectors needed to be modified. while much of this could have been done by adding id's, I felt it necessary to take the time to learn more about the framework and how it is organized. 

 A problem I have not been able to solve yet is on the portfolio page, the viewport is small, for some reason my background image of the `<body>` element drops down instead of staying at the top, i only have this
 issue on this page.

Elements of my project are as follows
* About: A shout bio with a photo of me and a navbar element leading to other pages.
  * [About](screenshots/About.jpg)

* Portfolio: a page with a link to our first project, and also place holder links for future projects.
  * [Portfolio](screenshots/Portfolio.jpg)

* Contact: A page with a short form that will also be used to get in contact with me once I learn how to make it do that.
  * [Contact](screenshots/Contact.jpg)

All pages have a footer element with links to gitHub and Linkedin.
